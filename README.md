# Piazza Reward Bot

Piazza is a popular platform that facilitates discussion between students and professors in a forum format. However, it does not provide very detailed statistics on student participation (e.g. number of questions posted and answered, upvotes), especially for large (> 25) classes. This bot reports personalized statistics and converts them into points as specified by the instructor. Students can track their own participation on the forum and compare their activity level to the most active students in the class. Instructors can use the bot to incentive students to participate more on Piazza.

Languages and tools used:
* Node.js
* Python (pymongo)
* MongoDB

Since this is a school project, the code cannot be shared. However, here is a demo of how the bot works. Please see the report and slides for further detail.
